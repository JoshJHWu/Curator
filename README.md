# Curator
### What it is
Curator uses the Reddit API and the NYTimes API to pull text data when queried with a search term. Based on data it pulls from Reddit and NYTimes, it uses jQuery to create beautiful word clouds displaying how the media vs individuals feel about the given search query.

### How it works
Curator has a Rails backend, which makes calls to the APIs when queried with a search term. It sends back data to the JavaScript and jQuery frontend, which shows up on a beautiful single-page app that was built using Materialize.

### When it was made
Curator was our product for [AngelHack Brooklyn 2016](http://angelhack.com/portfolio-item/brooklyn-usa-may-7-8-2016/). We built it
in 1.5 days!
