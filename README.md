# Curator
### What it is
Curator uses the Reddit API and the NYTimes API to pull text data when queried with a search term. It uses this data to make a call to the HPE Haven OnDemand API, which parses and extracts concepts. These concepts are returned to the frontend, where the jQuery library jQCloud uses it to create beautiful word clouds displaying how the media vs individuals feel about the given search query.

### When it was made
Curator was our product for [AngelHack Brooklyn 2016](http://angelhack.com/portfolio-item/brooklyn-usa-may-7-8-2016/). We built it
in 1.5 days!
